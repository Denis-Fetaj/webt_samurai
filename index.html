        <h2><span>-The History-</span></h2>
        <p>The samurai, members of a powerful military caste in feudal Japan, began as provincial
             warriors</br> before rising to power in the 12th century with the beginning of the country’s
              first military</br> dictatorship, known as the shogunate. As servants of the daimyos, or great lords,
                the</br> samurai backed up the authority of the shogun and gave him power over the</br> mikado (emperor).
                The samurai would dominate Japanese government</br> and society until the Meiji Restoration of 1868
                 led to the abolition</br> of the feudal system. Despite being deprived of their traditional</br> privileges,
                  many of the samurai would enter the elite ranks of</br> politics and industry in modern Japan. More importantly,
                   the</br> traditional samurai code of honor, discipline and morality</br> known as bushido – or “the way of the warrior” – was</br>
                    revived and made the basic code of conduct for</br> much of Japanese society.

        <h2><span>-The Living of the Samurai-</span></h2>
        <p>The life of a samurai can be devided into 4 important events:</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>the birth</li>
                <li>the initiation ritual on entry into adult life</li>
                <li>marriage</li>
                <li>death</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>In the samurai era there was no direct separation of the private and public.
           The Samurai was integrated into a certain community by birth </br> and status that was only his
           left little room for the development of his own personality. The life of the samurai was marked </br>
            by a strong sense of honor and loyalty. This sense of honor related not only on oneself, but on the
            whole </br> family and their ancestors. That was passed on from generation to generation and defended </br> down to 
            the blood. A samurai knew no mercy when it came to defending honor; </br> neither against himself nor against other.
            he samurai had many privileges. </br> He was allowed to carry two swords and, if necessary, these too
            deploy. </br> He was also allowed to kill a man of low rank without him to report </br> an incident if that person has acted against the law.
            The samurai </br> but also had a role model function, this required strict </br> self-discipline and a unconditional life according to </br> Bushido.
            A developed and defined by the samurai, </br> unwritten code of honor to which they </br> submitted unconditionally.

        <h2>How were Samurais trained?</h2>
           <p>The training to become a samurai started at the age of 3. They start by learning figting techniques</br>
              with a sword that is made of bamboo stick. At the age of 5 it is said they were</br>
              given real weapons like the <em>Mamori-gatana</em> sword for self defence. </br>
              Their training proram was designed to teach them the so called <em>bushido way.</em><img id="Mamori" src="Mamori-gatana.jpg" alt="Mamori-gatana" ></br>

        <p>This example of a typical training program for a young samurai is similar to the program</br>
           for the rest of the week. They also had special activities sometimes, these included</br>
           standing waist deep in snow, going a day without food or sitting under a cold waterfall</br>
           to prepare them for missions at harsh weather.</p>
